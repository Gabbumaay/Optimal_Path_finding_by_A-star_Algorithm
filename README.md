# CS201 Shortest Path Finder - A* Algorithm
## Introduction
This project implements the A* algorithm in C to find the shortest path in a graph. The A* algorithm is a widely used pathfinding algorithm in computer science and is particularly effective for applications like route planning and navigation.

## Features
- A* algorithm implementation in C
- Finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph
- Heuristic function for efficient pathfinding
- Customizable input graph
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: git clone <https://github.com/Gabbumaay/project-k-cs203/>
2. Compile the source code:
3. Run the program: 
## Usage
1. Modify the input graph in the graph.c file.
2. Compile the code as described in the "Getting Started" section.
3. Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to find the shortest path.
